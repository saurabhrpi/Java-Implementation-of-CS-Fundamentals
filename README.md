# Java Implementation of Data Structures and Algo Fundamentals
My implementation of some of the basic coding challenges in Computer Science Fundamentals in Core Java. 

## Problems targeted  
Design algorithms to manipulate  
* strings and arrays.  
* linked lists.  
* stacks and queues.
* trees and graphs.  

Brief detail about each problem solved have been provided in the code check in comments section.
