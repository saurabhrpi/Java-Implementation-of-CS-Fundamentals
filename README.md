# Java Implementation of Data Structures and Algo Fundamentals
My implementation of some of the basic challenges in Computer Science Fundamentals. 
The edition of CTCI mentioned is 6th.

## Problems targeted  
Create an algorithm to  
* find if a string contains all unique characters. (findUniqueChars.java)  
* replace every space of a sequnce of strings with %20. (URLify.java)  
* find if two given strings are permutations of each other. (Permutation.java)  
* find if the given string has one or more palindromes in its permutation. (PalindromePerm.java)  
* sort a string by using merge sort technique. (MergeSort.java)  
* sort a string by using heap sort technique. (HeapSort.java)  
* find if the two given strings differ by one character difference at max. (EditDiff.java)  
* compress a string by removing its repeated characters. (CompressString.java)
